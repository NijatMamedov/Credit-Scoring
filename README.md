# Credit-Scoring
🔄 Pre-Processing for Logistic Regression 💡
Let’s prepare the data before modeling — clean data = better results! 🧼✨

📚 1. Import Libraries We load libraries like pandas, numpy, and sklearn for data handling and transformation. 🛠️

📥 2. Read Data We load the dataset and take a quick look at structure and values. 👀

📊 3. Descriptive Stats Basic stats like mean, min, max, and mode help us understand the data. 🧠

❓ 4. Handle Missing Values We check for missing values and replace them if needed (mean, mode, etc.). 🚫

🎯 5. Create Target Variable From the credit_score column:

If value is 'poor', set score = 1

Else, score = 0

This new score column is our binary target. ✅❌

⚙️ 6. WoE Transformation We apply WoE to both numeric and categorical features. 📉

📈 7. Check Distributions We review if features are normally distributed. 🔍

📌 8. Correlation Keep:

Features with >10% correlation with target

Features with <70% correlation between each other

📊 This helps reduce redundancy.

🚀 9. Final Variables Choose inputs (independent variables) and output (score) for the model. Done! 🤖✅



🤖 Modeling the Logistic Regression Model 💥
Time to build, train, and evaluate the model! 🚀

🧪 1. Train-Test Split We split the data into training and testing sets using test_size=0.3. This helps evaluate performance on unseen data. 🔄

🧠 2. Build Logistic Regression Model We train a logistic regression model using the training data. Simple and effective! ✔️

🧾 3. Evaluation Function We create a function to compute:

Confusion matrix 📉

AUC score 🎯

Gini coefficient 📊

📈 4. Model Evaluation We use our function to check how well the model performs using the test set. Key metrics: Gini, AUC, and confusion matrix. ✅❌

🧩 5. ROC Curve We plot the ROC curve for visualizing model performance and Gini score. 📉📊

🎯 6. Precision & Recall We plot precision vs. recall to find the best balance point — very helpful in binary classification. ⚖️



📊 Univariate Gini Analysis
For each variable, show the Gini score on both the train and test sets. This helps identify how well each feature performs individually. 🎯



📊 Selected Variables for New Model
In the Univariate analysis, we keep variables with a Gini score above 40% from the test set and build a new model based on these selected features. 🎯



🚀 Deployment with WOE
Deploy the model on the provided prod_data_with_woe dataset! 🖥️


📊 Predict Default Probability (PD) Use model.predict_proba() to show the probability of customers defaulting (PD). This helps predict the likelihood of default. 💡


🚀 Deployment with Real Values
We deploy the trained model using the provided file: test_data_real_values.xlsx 📂



🔍 Predicting Default Probabilities (PD)
For each customer in the test data, we calculate their probability of default (PD) using the model. 📉💳

This gives a clear view of risk levels for real-world cases! 🎯
